Study Title: Predicting Radiological Panel Opinions Using a Panel of Machine Learning Classifiers
Authors: Dmitriy Zinovev, Daniela Raicu, Jacob Furst and Samuel G. Armato III
 
Summary: This paper uses an ensemble of classifiers and active learning strategies to
          predict radiologists’ assessment of the nodules of the Lung Image Database Consortium
          (LIDC). In particular, the paper presents machine learning classifiers that model agreement
          among ratings in seven semantic characteristics. The ensemble of classifiers (which can be considered as
          a computer panel of experts) uses 64 image features of the nodules across four categories 
          to predict semantic characteristics. The active learning
          begins the training phase with nodules on which radiologists’ semantic ratings agree, and
          incrementally learns how to classify nodules on which the radiologists do not agree. Using
          the proposed approach, the classification accuracy of the ensemble of classifiers is higher
          than the accuracy of a single classifier.
 
 
 
Data set: LIDC
Size: 914 nodules from 207 patients
 
Features: spiculation, lobulation, texture, sphericity, margin, subtlety, and malignancy
 
Modality: Thoratic CT
 
public or private?: Public 
 
Methodology: the use of an ensemble of classifiers and active learning strategies to
              predict radiologists’ assessment of the nodules using a kappa statistics interpretation scale
             Selecitve Iterative Classification through the Decorative Algorithm
 
Results: using nodules with a high level of agreement as initially labeled data and automatically labeling 
          the data on which disagreement exists, the proposed approach can correctly predict 70% of the 
          instances contained in the dataset.
 
Limitations: May not be used in field until higher accuracy is seen 
 
Goal: to increase consistency among radiological interpretations of lung nodule characteristics
 
Strengths: lots of data for the reader to evaluate in the form of graphs and tables 
           visuals of algorithms lead to a more intuitive understanding 

Weaknesses: results section takes a lot of close attention to see the success of the final result, however
              this is cleared up in the conclusion secition
            Data set specifics vary quite a bit, however normalization techniques are mentioned
