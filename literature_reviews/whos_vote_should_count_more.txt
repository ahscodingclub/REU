Authors: Jacob Whitehill, Paul Ruvolo, Tingfan Wu, Jacob Bergsma, and Javier Movellan
 
Summary: Machine learning algorithms require a large amount of data to be trained which is hard to collect. Sometimes
          training data can be skewed for a label, and this can be based on range of expertise of the labeler and difficulty
          of the image to label, which can lead to the difficulty of how to use all of the data, while eliminating noise,     
          possibly by combining the data in some form of distrobution
