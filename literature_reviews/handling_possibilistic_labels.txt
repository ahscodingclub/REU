Study Title: Handling possibilistic labels in pattern classi#cation using evidential reasoning
Authors: Thierry Den'ux, Lalla Meriem Zouhal
 
Summary: Two approaches are proposed, based either on the transformation of each possibility distribution into 
          a consonant belief function, or on the use of generalized belief structures with fuzzy focal elements
         Methods for combining multiple experts data for a label are discussed, and a fuzzy vector is presented
          that represents the likelihood of class membership for each of the k classes  
         Non zero elements in a BBA are called focal elements
