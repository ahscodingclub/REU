Summary: TCP generates the most likely prediction and a valid measure of confidence, as well 
            as the set of all possible predictions for a given confidence level
         processing of MRI data is done to provide a confidence of the individual having a 
          neurological depressive disorder
         A conformity measure is how well the current input matches other inputs that 
          the model was trained on, ensuring confidence in the classification
 
Data set: (FDx) dataset contained functional MRI data from 19 patients with depression and 19 matched healthy controls 
          (SPx) dataset consisted of structural MRI data in 18 patients with depression who subsequently received
            treatment with antidepressant medication. Following 8 weeks oftreatment, 9 of the 18 patients achieved 
            a full clinical remission based on standard clinical response criteria

Size: (19X2)(18X2)
 
Features: MRI Images with associated prognosis
 
Modality: MRI
 
public or private?: public 
 
Methodology: using TCP to attempt to classify with a confidence rating what neurological markers
              are evident in depressed individuals as to classify them properly as experiencing 
              or not experiencing depression ontop of a pre-studied svm setup
 
Results: TCP analysis revealed that increased BOLD responses activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate, superior frontal and
          precentral cortices during implicit processing of high-intensity sad faces classified patients with depression,
          while increased activity in the insula, angular cortex and cerebellum predicted healthy control status
 
Limitations:
 
Goal: identify neurological markers of depression
 
Strengths: to the point, building off of previous work
           very readable results table
        

Weaknesses: example images were saved until the end of the paper 
            a lot of details relied on previous work
