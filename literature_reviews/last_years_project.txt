Study Title: Building confidence and credibility into CAD with belief decision trees
Authors: Rachael N. Affenit, Erik R. Barns, Jacob D. Furst, Alexander Rasin, Daniela S. Raicu
 
Summary: build classification system for learning from and predicting the whole distribution of 
          radiologists’ annotations
         incorporating conformal prediction (CP) into the classifier
 
 
 
Data set: Annotated LIDC

Size: 809 annotated, increased to 850 by selective under and over sampling  
 
Features: image data, the radiologists’ nodule outlines, and the radiologists’ subjective
            ratings of nodule characteristics 
 
Modality: CT
 
public or private?: Public
 
Methodology: Belief Decision Trees with Selective iterative classification and Conformal Prediction with 
              the addition of label weighting and label distrobutions for the improvement of classification
              accuracy
 
Results: 84% accuracy of classifying 2 label weighted lung nodule images for malignancy 
 
Limitations: more ratings for the end user as to help integration into real world applications
 
Goal: classifying malignant lung nodules with confidence 
 
Strengths: the use of examples helped understanding of methodologies 
           informing graphs showed the true nature of results 

Weaknesses: a few wording situations lead to conclusions (might not have been final copy)
            short conclusion that did not give significance to findings
