Study Title: Learning On Probabilistic Labels
Authors: Peng Peng, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, Phillp S. Yu 
 
Summary: Sometimes in a clear cut dataset, some informatoin is lost, due to the forced decision
         A noise-insensitive classifier is presented to learn probababilistic labels given that some 
          of the labels may be of low quality 
         A method for deriving the error bounds of a classifier with probabilistic bounds on a data set 
          of known size is presented
