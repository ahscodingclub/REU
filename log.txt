clean up the way the id reference is done to be similar to the way it was done last year, after some experimentation is done

Observed on testing data set that if the tree predicted the same node for all of the train cases that it might have had to make an original split anyway so the unusable node in testing on training might have been used in training, meaning that typicality is legitamately 0 

there is legitametly a decision onde that isn't used while testing on the training set; in test_1_5 this can be seen as the tree makes a test prediction that was not made while classifying the traininng set

outliers: 
if x > q3 + 1.5(IQR)
if x < q1-1.5(IQR)

total distance was not definitive of atypical cases, however if all non used features are removed from nodule vectors better results may be seen, then the specific features can be isolated that are definitive of atypical cases
	
could state a correlation between the top 25% of cases and what percent of them fall in the corelation of atypical cases, showing that as we get to th emore importatnt features the coreelation becomes hgither, eventually locateing the single featurethat we have the highest correlation rate for 

also check whether the same nodules are coming up as atypical between the different aggregates, if not we can roll with the mean, due to the best nature of mean

the typicality and distance atypical typical feature plots looked similar, hopefully meaning that nodules classifed as atypical by the BDT are farthest away in feature space

the intersection between the two sets may be a good place to look for truly atypical nodules

now going to take the 25% most atypical nodules from both sets and have them be the atypical cases in the feature plots
