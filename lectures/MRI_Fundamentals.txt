Core idea behind tomographic imaging -- differnt views are taken from varying perspectives and
  reconstructed to provide an overall view of the scanning object

In MRI we are interested in materials with magnetic resonance, such as water filled tissue, 
  however bone does not have any magnetic resonance 

protons (singular proton in a hydrogen atom) act as a positively charge needles

during MRI aquasition, a magnetic field is applied to a patient, aligning all the 
  protons in the body, then an rf pulse tips the spinning protons out of alignments, 
  causing the spinning protons to oscilate, which in turn produces and rf signal 
  which can be measures

stationary magnet produces a constant magnetic field, which is always on due to the complications
  of shutting down the liquid nitrogen cooled super magnet

The field is denoted as B-naught 

two posibilities of alignment could occur, being a low energy state of natural magnetic alignment 
  and a high engergy quasi-stable state or non-natural state 

the net matgnitization M-naught is resultant of 3 more parts per million protons being at a low energy 
  state than a high energy state, allowing for a small net magnitization

An mri scanner is very long to allow for a uniform magnetic field at the anatomic site of imaging

the frequency that a spinning mass of charge precesses in a magnetic field is denoted as f-naught

the aggregate frequency of precession is denoted as M

Q: why is this processing occuring

applying a force at the same frequency of precession at the same point in the precession arc
on every rotation will open the cone of procession, making it more obtuse

radio waves are analguous to the string pulling the gyroscope at the same point in the precession
  route

M-naught is the actual magnetic vector, with M being the magnitude, which is what we 
  are manipulating

Q: what is this magnetic precession? is the precessing just an analogy to gravity or
  is the magnetic precession actually a paricle oscilating

a gradient magnet varying in intensity is applied to detect different materials and 
  amount of materials at different locations due to different resonance frequencies
  at different levels of magnetic field intensity (Tesla)

you know where the water is located due to the frequency that it is resonating at and
  relating it to the strength of the field at that point

z-plane -- longitudinal dimension
x-y plane -- transverse plain

the transmission coil is orthogonal to the detection coil, and they are not on at the same time, 
  however once the transmission coil is turned off, the M vector wants to return to the steady state
  with 0 amplitude

amplitude of frequency can be 0, however procession is occuring still at the laramore rate

free induction decay 

T1 - relaxation rate, the rate at which the amplitute returns to 0
