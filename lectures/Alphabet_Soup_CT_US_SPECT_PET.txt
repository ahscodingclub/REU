CT SPECT PET are all tomographies, US is not

CT, SPECT, PET all use radiation, US does not

X-RAYS can be created in two ways, Bremstralum interactions, or in the
event of a sudden vacancy of an innter shell electron

* Computed Tomography (CT)

started with only being able to scale on the axial plane

coronal, axial and sagital all the three medical imaging planes

coronal -- front to back (anterior to posterior)

axial -- top to bottom (superior to inferior) or (crainial to codal) 

sagital -- left to right (medial to lateral)

ct allows all three dimenstions to be seen -- coronal and sagital in each 
image, with axial images stacked

images are normally taken in a way that they are layning on the table
and you are looking up through their feet

image reconstruction is performed from collected data, being the computed
aspect of computed tomography 

tomography -- reconstructing sensor data from different projections 
to produce a projection that was never aquired

helical ct is now the standard, when the patient table is continuisly 

during ct there is a ring 360* of detectors, which help aquire the position
of x-ray blocking material 

in real life this is done in 1* incriments 

when figuring out the intensity at each pixel of the computed image, 
the process of computing pixel intensity from an angular intensity 
projection is called backprojection

houndsfield invented this technique

houndsfield numbers are the meaningful data behind the intensity of 
a pixel, with water being 0, bone being 1000 and air being -1000

* Riadionuclide Imaging 

gamma rays come from the nuclied of atoms, from the decay of the nucleus 

INTERESTING IDEA: are there lower energy photons that can be sent through 
patients and higher sensitivity sensors to prevent radiation overdose??

an x-ray that emits from nucleus decay is a gamma ray 

Planar Imaging -- in this imaging modality, x-rays are sent out from the inside of the patient
by exciting the nuclei of radio-pharmaceutical injection

tachnesium 99m is attached to protein globs in a saline injection

m stands for the nucleus being in a meta-stable state, with a half life of 2 hours 

the protein globs get stuck in the capallary beds (not all of them) and emit radiation 
in order to be detected 

this imaging techique can show where blood is not getting to parts in the lung

this is a functional imaging modality capture how a biological system is functioning 

* SPECT -- Single Photon emission computed tomography 

spect is applying ct to the nuclear imaging world


* PET -- Positiron Emission Tomorgraphy 

goes on the idea that a particle itself can be emitted (positron) as opposed
to a photon (energy) 

when a proton converts to a neutron, it releases a positron (photon of charge?), which 
is the antimatter of an electron 

Fluorene 18 is used for positron emission  

Glucose is tagged with Flurene 18, which can show where cancer is due to the increase
metabolism of cancerous cells 

also used for analysis of cognitive acts, being that more active regions of the brain 

when a positron and an electron encounter eachother, an xray conversion occurs 

2 x rays are generated by this interaction, 511 kev each (RME is used for the conversion) 

RME -- Rest Mass Energy 

Also, these x rays are in total opposite directions, which can allow us to make use
of all of these interactions in the CT step

* Ultra sound 

waves propigate (pressure) not particles (longitudianl wave)

ultrasound scanner uses the time delay from sound wave sent and time 
requied to return 

all sound waves are returned before the next sound wave is sent

time is depth (top to bottom of image) , density of sound reflected is brightness

dopler ultrasound -- adding a color overlay for blue -- black -- yellow, used for blood flow

makes use of the dople affect

INTERSTING IDEA: programming the dopler affect visualization in java would be cool 

this helps for blood because blood moving toward or away from the transducer
will produce a doplar affect in regards to the acoustic properties of the 
material around it
