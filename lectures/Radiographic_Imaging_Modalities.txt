x-rays were used for tumor treatment within the first year of discovery

Thomas Edison attempted at creating x-rays in a more effiecient way

the dangers of x rays were unknown for a long time, with some in shoe stores
until the 1950s

for chest radiographs, holding a deep breath is important as it exposes upper and lower lungs

* Generation of beam --> differential attenuation --> grid (image receptor)

a radiographic image is a negative type image, with lighter areas being higher attenuated
areas, blocing more x-rays

x-ray is not a proper term, it is a radiographic attenuated image

sometimes while radiographing, x-rays are reflected from hitting atoms in the body

the grids mentioned only allow x-rays that are coming in at the correct angle

cool thing to look up: optical density of developed film

35 keV are sent into a tissue of 10cm in height, being width wise half tissue, half bone

aluminum step wedges are used in calibration of radiograph machines

Bremsstrahlung -- breaking radiation -- charged particles may interact through coulumn-force interactions
to produce radiation 

if a high speed electron orbits close around an atomic nucleus, the electron will change directions, 
but a tangential photon is flung called a Bremsstahlung photon

a photon is a pure energy, massless particle 

a spectrum of photons will different energy levels are made and flung in different directions

when producing x-rays, a current is ran through a filament, liberating elections. A negatively charged
cloud of electrons are now attracted to a positively charged anode (target material -- tungsten)

this tungesten is where the Bremsstahlung interactions are occurning, then later focused

* Geomety of X-rays

x-ray beams are not a parallel beams, we can treat uv as parallel because of the distance to the source

x-rays therfore are a diverging beam, leading to some realaties that need to be dealt with
  intensity differences are based on the inverse square law
  magnification
  projection considerations

projection: diverging beams complicate the issue

AP -- anterior --> posterior (front to back)

if non-important parts of the patient are farther from the recepter, than a maginfication of the non-important
parts will be increased

PA is prefered for chest radiographs, due to the heart being an important organ to check

also, enlarged heart is something that radiologists attempt to evaluate

while looking at a radiograph, radiologists look for any possible complication

there are lead veins in the grid that block angled x-rays from reaching the receptor

** Fluoroscopy

kind of similar to the early days of radiography, getting a real time image

blood flow is a good reason to get a real time x-rays

interventional radiology uses fluoroscopy as its main modality

a device called an image intensifier is used on the receptive end of the image so that 
less x-rays can be used, however not used for static images due to image obfiscation 

all ranges of B photons and other x-rays must be utilized, with some particles having higher
penetration power than others, however all must have the same effect on the receptor

**** Image processing

* perception
  
A 2d representation of a cube is really 12 lines that are oriented in s way 
to mimic 3d structures
