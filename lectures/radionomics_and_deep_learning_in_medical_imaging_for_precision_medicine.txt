Author's main field is in image enrichment to help disease diagnosis

Focuses are in mamorgraphy, ultrasound and mri

An issue with mammorgraphy is that it cannot distinguish between tumor
and dense tissue

Computer aided detetection is often used in screening, decreasing the 
amound of misses by drawing attention to possible regions

Precision Medicine Initiative: nned the right treatment for the right 
patient at the right time, using technology

there are a lot differences across and within tumors

can features coupled with genomics(sampling) produce a higher predictive power?

in the discovery stage, relationships are found between images and genomics (imaging genomics)

diagnostic imaging: biopsy results, genetics, testing results
  trying to relate imaging to everything else
  THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO IRRADICATE NECESSITY OF BIOPSY

translation: predictive modeling, applying prior knowledge

radiomics have only been called that for a few years

deep learning was in the first FDA approved CAD

in conventional cad, tumor features are extracted before classified

in deep learning, only the localized tumor, with no extracted features
are the input

tumor segmentation is strongly dependent in how good the output of features
and later classifiers will be

fuzzy c means was used to process uptake/time lines to determine threshold
of hetergeniety for malignant

fuzzy c means for background and tumor, then again for kinetic analysis
  in order to determine what class is benign and malignent, you can 
  look at uptake thresholds

fuzzy c means output trend is used as the most enhancing uptake curve

feature selection

OUTPUT WAS A HISTOGRAM OF TRAINING EXAMPLES, WITH AN ARROW OF WHERE
THIS CASE FALLS 

2% is used as a high enough level to biopsy

lecun -- deep learning for filering of classification of calcification
 
deep learning as classifier of probability of malignancy is possible

author uses deep learning as a feature extractor for the tumor

image net set are pretrained convolutional neural nets

the activations of layers of the cnn become features for classifier

0 variance features are removed (non helpful features)

TCGA and TCIA public data sets 

TCGA assembler pulls all data together from online and assembles case
genomics and radiomics together

spatially correlated muli-omics analyses is the new goal
  they need to relate the pathology to the histomics

ROC CURVIVE

sensitivity = TPF (selecting all candidates)
specificity = 1-FPF (overcall)

reader studies are how reading improves when using cad
