* This is just one piece of medical informatics
* Radiologists asses images for the documented study
* an image is a digital representation of a real world scene
* Pixels are parameterized by position, intensity and time
* discreteness of space: the space is not fully contained
* intensity: most cameras have 256 levels of intensity
* rgb is an example of intensity (of each channel)
* more intensity helps mammography 
* meta-precision how much precision do you capture, store and display?
* x,y,z,t,i -- how to formalize the R of images
** Normally 
* two spacial parameters -- x and y
* three intensity parameters (R,G,B)
** Ultrasound
* same two spacial parameters (sometimes 3 in cardiology)
* 1 intensity parameter (ultrasound reflection)
* 1 time parameter 
** False color imaging -- assigning color based on intensity (Self organizing maps?)
  * this may add false edges
  * color edge versus intensity edge
** Digital X-Ray
* Two spatial -- x and y 
* A single intensity parameter -- x-ray attenuation -- reduction of x-ray signal
** Digital Video
* same two spatial, three intensity, one time parameter -- frame #
** Other kinds of images
* Computed Tomography -- 3d x-ray
* Satellite imagery -- 4 intensities rgb and infrared
* Functional Magnetic Resonance Images -- 3d images of the body overtime
* Not all images represent visual phenomena but a visualization can be a 
  very effective way to understand the phenomena 
** Pixels
* Give the image a name I or F
* Specify all of the parameters of the image
* the result is the intensity
** CT IS ALWAYS IN 3D
* Image processing attempts to restoring, enhancing and understanding images
** Restoration
  * remove noise
  * restoring old images
** Enhancement
  * used to enhance the contrast
  * some can work in smaller neighborhoods
* Image understanding contains different tasks
  * segmentation -- identifying objects
  * classification -- assigning labels to pixels
  * interpretation -- extracts meaning from the image as a whole
* Creating Images
  * spatial sampling 
  * quantization -- intensity sampling -- levels of intensity
  * spatial sampling rates affect details
* we are less sensitivie to quantization then resolution changes
