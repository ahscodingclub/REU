A computer aided diagnosis is a diagnosis by a radiologist with the benefit of output generated by a computer
  this diagnosis is really a decision

Computers working as a diagnostic aid

there are limitations in the eye-brain system

there is structure noise in images, meaning that there is a lot of stuff going on, leading to a
"wheres waldo" situation where you know what you are looking for and that it is present, but 
the observer can't find it

now add the concept that it isnt there, leads to a large issue

CAD can reduce interpretation errors

X-rays are simply photons on the em-spectrum with higher energy than UV spectrum particles

an image produced through medium of x-rays is called a radiography

Renken was the founder of x-rays, leading x-ray imaging to be called renkenography for while
before being called radiography

radiographs are photonegative 

CT greatly reduces structural noise -- computed axial tomography -- no longer axial due to advanced 
computing

there is still structure noise in CT, just to a lesser extent

diagnostic tasks: 1) identify presence of abnormality, 2) assessment of the severity of the abnormality

computer aided diagnosis is really computer aided decision

CAD is almost becoming necessary because of imaging technology advancements, with lots of data

FDA approval for mammography CAD: 1998, 2002

FDA approval for chest radiography CAD

Medicare reimburstment for CAD in mammography began is 2001 of $19.13 every time CAD is used on a patient

private payer reimburstment for lung cancer detection began in 2006

there is CAD research in every modality 

CAD research by anatomic regions

CAD research by task: detection, classification, volume analysis, risk assesment, temporal comparison ...
  multi-modality fusion is also a good idea 

before FDA approval an experiment is done to see how the radiologists do themselves vs. how they do with 
the CAD system on the same data set with some time inbetween

--Examples From Abdomen, Breast, and Chest--

CT colonography ("virtual colonoscopy") is becoming viable without endoscopic evaluation of the colon

**first the colon is segmented out of the ct, then it is virtually rendered, then candidate selection and 
classification needs to happen (This is really cool)

some mammographers can miss breast cancer, as seen with ha 15% increase in detection with a second reading
from another mammographer

ultrasound is normally a second look at suspicious candidates of breast cancer

contrast enhanced mri is also used for breast imaging -- temporal aspect gives a lot of idication
of malignancy 

Pet ct scans
